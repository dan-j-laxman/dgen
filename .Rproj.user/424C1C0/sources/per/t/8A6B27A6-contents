Description: dgen is intended for use within the dplyr::mutate() function to create new variables. All funcitons extract and combine information within a row across columns (variables). Functions can be used to generate new variables from existing variables (allowing for some level of missing data), calculate the row mean of values for a set of variables (allowing for some level of missing data), and count the number of missing and non-missing values in a set of variables.
